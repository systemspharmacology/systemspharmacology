title:  "Comparing building blocks and simulations in PK-Sim速 and MoBi速"
description: "Finding differences between a template building block and a building block used in a simulation, or comparing two simulations is an essential tool to understand how a model is built. This tutorial explains how to perform such a comparison in PK-Sim速 and MoBi速"
